# MOLE PyMOL/Chimera plugin

This is [MOLE2.5](https://webchem.ncbr.muni.cz/Platform/App/Mole) plugin for Pymol/Chimera macromolecular visualiyation systems. There is also a [web version](https://mole.upol.cz/) available.

This plugin allows you to calculate macromolecular channels within [PyMOL](https://pymol.org) and [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) environments as well as load computation results from the web interface..

## Requirements

This plugin was developed some time ago when Python 2.x was still a thing, and as such it presently does not support modern versions of PyMOL and ChimeraX. Plugin was tested and should work with the following versions of the software:

* Pymol 1.8.x
* Chimera 1.x

Update of the plugin to support Python 3.x and ChimeraX is ongoing.

## How to use it?

Please consult the [manual](https://webchem.ncbr.muni.cz/Wiki/Mole:Plugins) to see how to install the software and how to use it.
